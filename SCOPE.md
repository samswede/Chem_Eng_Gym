# Future Dimensions of Process Systems Engineering (PSE) Technology

The landscape of PSE technology is broad, with future developments likely to be influenced by advancements in deep reinforcement learning. This document outlines some dimensions that describe this landscape. It is presented in the form of a checklist to keep track of the scope of this open-source project as it evolves.

## Simulator Complexity

### Solver Capabilities

Depending on the nature of the system and the level of detail required, various types of differential equations can be employed:

- [X] Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)
- [X] Differential-Algebraic Equations (DAEs)
- [ ] High Index DAEs
- [ ] Partial Differential-Algebraic Equations (PDAEs)
- [ ] High Index PDAEs

Note: as I am a mere mortal, I do not have the competence nor ambition to build a fully Equation Oriented process software like gPROMS in python. But if YOU are convinced you have what it takes and for some reason want to implement it here for the sake of open source, then by all means do so.

### Scale of Analysis

The scale of analysis can vary widely, from the molecular level to the global economy:

- [X] Molecular Scale
- [X] Particle Scale
- [X] Equipment or Unit Operation Scale
- [X] Process Plant Scale
- [ ] Supply Chain Scale
- [ ] Regional or National Economy Scale
- [ ] Global or Circular Economy Scale

### Synthetic and Biological System Modeling

Modeling of synthetic and biological systems can be complex due to inherent non-linearities, and the vast number of variables involved. Here are some types of models used in these systems:

- [ ] Stoichiometric models
- [ ] Michaelis-Menten models
- [ ] Genomic models
- [ ] Proteomic models
- [ ] Metabolic models
- [ ] Cell population models
- [ ] Whole organism models
- [ ] Organ models


## Model Deployment

The deployment of the model can occur at various stages of the product life cycle and process development. Here are some potential stages where the model can be deployed:

### Product Specification

- [ ] Ideation or Conceptualization
- [ ] Feasibility Analysis
- [ ] Preliminary Design
- [ ] Detailed Design for Manufacture

### Process Design

- [ ] Conceptual Design
- [ ] Front-End Engineering Design (FEED)
- [ ] Equipment Design
- [ ] Detailed Engineering and Construction
- [ ] Process Commissioning

### Process Operations

- [ ] Routine Operations

- [ ] Operational Planning and Optimization

In the context of synthetic and biological systems, models can be deployed in a range of applications:

### Synthetic and Biological Product Specification

- [ ] Drug discovery and development
- [ ] Genetic engineering and synthetic biology
- [ ] Development of biotechnological products (enzymes, biofuels, etc.)
- [ ] Alternative proteins (food)
