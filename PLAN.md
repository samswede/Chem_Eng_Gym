This is a planning section to keep track of ideas and progress

STANDARDISATION

    Docstring style
    - Google style:
        """
        Short description.

        Longer description if necessary.

        Args:
            arg1 (type): Description for arg1.
            arg2 (type): Description for arg2.

        Returns:
            type: Description of returned object.

        Raises:
            ErrorType: Description of conditions that cause this error.

    - User stories
        - To keep development focused and keep track of scope and functionality I have included a user story template
        - This is to practice ATDD and to make it easier to opensource


IDEAS:
    - Make a dictionary that maps elements in node feature vector to corresponding properties
        - means that feature retrieval does not have to be hard coded, and is flexible in size and order
        - should me flexible to change as things develop
        - should be possible to make one automatically based on what process units, components and reactions are included

    Thermodynamics and Kinetic Data
    - Webscrape thermodynamic and kinetic data from NIST chemistry webbook
        - should be fun. A useful skill and fucking sick example.
        - should be able to automatically extract whatever info and store it in useful file formats to be loaded later.
        - could be reason to use a chemistry GPT model. 
    
    

    COSTING
    - Include costing as an instance method in the base_process_unit
    - include property decorators to create property attributes for process unit classes
        - e.g. volume from input dimensions of a reactor, 
        - if possible, make cost a property? Need to figure out what the drawbacks of that is.
    - can i upload a pdf of Rules of Thumb in Engineering and/or Towler & Sinnot and use GPT to extract capex and opex models? That would be insanely cool and useful. I also want to learn how to do that in general.


    DBPS and DAE solving
    - i need to automatically build the DAE formulations, and reduce to index 1. Quite a task, but if I can do that im god and would do very well in the exam.
    - can I add the models together from different process unit classes and try and solve the bigger DAE?
    - what does a recycle actually involve?
    - 

    Process File Formats
    - should be able to save as SFILE strings
    - need to think about efficient datastructures for replay buffers and saving experience
        - keeping track of the latest index was not a great solution
            - the 'info' part returned by the environment should be a dictionary that includes the latest added node or whatever.
    - what should the 'info' contain?

    Visualisation
    - It needs to look professional, but not dull like aspen.
    - 

    Process Analysis
    - Should be able to perform sensitivity analysis
    - Implement control regimes for batch reactors from DBPS
    - I want to be able to run simulations and plot results in graphs
    - Parameter estimation. Don't know what it is but need to know for exam, and what better way to learn than to do.

CODING PRACTICES

    Test Driven Development
    - Start by making a test of the class, and then make the code via red, green, refactor. This will keep things modular and maintainable.
    It will be slow at first, but slow is smooth and smooth is fast.
    - This will not accumulate technical debt

    Law of Demeter
    - Ensure that this practice is followed so that no one class needs deep knowledge of the nested methods and inner workings of other objects it calls. This level of abstraction makes sure things don't break and new people can easily add things.
