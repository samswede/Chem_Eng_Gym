TO DO:
    - Fix networkx graph.
        - Currently, the outlet stream is dangling
        - Decide if streams should be nodes or edges
            - if edges, determine how to add and replace empty "action nodes"
            - I think action nodes are visually great because they offer the affordance of clicking on them
                they could be colored and shown in a way that begs you to click on them. Like pulsating.
                When you do, it passes that through the agent and you somehow see the recommended options
